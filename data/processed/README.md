# Processed Data

This directory contains processed data files used in the analysis.

## Files

- `bib_sampled_sentences.txt`: Sampled sentences from the Bias in Bios dataset for each occupation
- `bib_sampled_sentences.pkl`: Pickle file containing a dictionary mapping occupation names to lists of sentences

## Format

The `bib_sampled_sentences.txt` file has the following format:

```
occupation|sentence
```

For example:

```
nurse|She is a registered nurse with over 10 years of experience in critical care.
software_engineer|He is a software engineer at Google working on machine learning projects.
```

The `bib_sampled_sentences.pkl` file contains a Python dictionary with the following structure:

```python
{
    'nurse': [
        'She is a registered nurse with over 10 years of experience in critical care.',
        'He has been a nurse for 5 years, specializing in pediatric care.',
        # ...
    ],
    'software_engineer': [
        'He is a software engineer at Google working on machine learning projects.',
        'She is a software engineer with expertise in distributed systems.',
        # ...
    ],
    # ...
}
```

## Generation

These files are generated by the `extract_bib_sentences.py` script, which:

1. Loads the Bias in Bios dataset from `data/raw/bios_train.pkl`
2. Extracts a fixed number of sentences (default: 20) for each occupation
3. Saves the extracted sentences to the files in this directory

To regenerate these files, run:

```bash
python src/data_processing/extract_bib_sentences.py
```
